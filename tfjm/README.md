## What it is ?

[TFJM²](https://tfjm.org/) or "Tournois Français des Jeunes Mathématiciennes et Mathématiciens" is a team mathematics competition.
<br>This tournament is divided into two phases :

- In the first one we are given [the subjects](https://tfjm.org/les-problemes/) and we are given a few months to try to solve problems and to write them.
- Then teams get together and discuss answers to problems.

<br>The file "ex4_2023_numworks.py" is a version of "ex4_2023.py" adapted for Numworks.
